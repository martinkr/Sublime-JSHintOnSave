Sublime-JSHintOnSave
====================

A Sublime Text plugin, that validates your js-files every time you save it. The best part: a growl notification showing a summary of errors and warnings. Inspired by 'Cross-Platform JSLint Support for Sublime Text Editor 2 (using NodeJS) by Eduardo A Lundgren Melo'
